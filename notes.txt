Buy and sell goods
Goods are constantly degrading in quality
System that updates inventory

SellIn = number of days we have to sell
Quality = value of item

End of Day = increment down value


Sell by date is past, quality degrade*2
Quality of item is never negative

“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items


*Changes to UpdateQuality method are fine

DO NOT TOUCH Item class or Items property
